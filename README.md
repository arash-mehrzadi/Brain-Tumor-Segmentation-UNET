# Description
The process of segmenting tumor from MRI image of a brain is one of the highly focused areas in the community of medical science as MRI is noninvasive imaging. Therefore, I decided to create Brain Tumor Segmentation Launch File that you can easily use the capabilities of this powerful tool. I am currently in the early stages of designing this Launch File and will be constantly updating these files to get to a usable version.
